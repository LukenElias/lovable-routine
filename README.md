# 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a full-stack developer with 10+ years of hands-on experience, from backend architecture to clean frontend delivery. I don't just code features; I build systems that reflect clarity, security, and long-term usefulness.

## 🧠 Core Skill Focus

**Infrastructure as Code**  
I believe reliable systems start at the infrastructure level. I use tools like Terraform, Pulumi, and AWS CDK to create cloud-native environments that are reproducible, secure, and scalable.

## 🌱 Philosophy

- I track what I learn, to turn chaos into clarity  
- I write and ship quietly, loud isn't better, *clear* is  
- I never overpromise, I deliver what is real, when it's ready  
- I protect my time and focus, mornings are sacred  
- I believe software should feel like it belongs
